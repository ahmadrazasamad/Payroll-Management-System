# Welcome to the Payroll Management System
Our cutting-edge Payroll Management System is meticulously designed on the bedrock principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), embodying the three foundational pillars:
### 1. Encapsulation
Our system encapsulates data and methods within distinct classes, ensuring a robust and secure structure. This shields sensitive information and operations, enhancing the overall integrity and reliability of the system and saves data from accidental changes.
### 2. Inheritance
Leveraging the power of inheritance, our system adopts a hierarchical structure. At the apex is the 'Employee' class, serving as the cornerstone for diverse employee types. The child classes—'Salaried Employee,' 'Hourly Employee,' 'Commission Employee,' and 'Base + Commission Employee'—inherit and extend functionalities from the parent class, fostering code reusability and a streamlined class hierarchy.
### 3. Polymorphism
The inherent flexibility of polymorphism is seamlessly integrated into our system. This allows for the utilization of a single interface for multiple employee types, promoting code efficiency and adaptability. Whether it's a salaried employee or one on a commission-based structure, our system effortlessly accommodates diverse employee profiles.
## Class Structure:
### Driver Class:
This class orchestrates the interactions among various components of the system, serving as the central hub for execution and coordination.
### Employee Class (Parent Class):
Positioned at the apex of the hierarchy, the 'Employee' class embodies common attributes and methods shared among all employee types. It lays the groundwork for a standardized and cohesive implementation.
### Salaried Employee Class:
Catering to individuals on a fixed salary, this class encapsulates attributes and methods specific to employees compensated on a monthly or annual basis.
### Hourly Employee Class:
Tailored for employees compensated based on hourly work, this class encapsulates functionalities attuned to hourly wage calculations and time-tracking.
### Commission Employee Class:
Designed for individuals earning based on sales commissions, this class encapsulates attributes and methods relevant to commission-based compensation structures.
### Base + Commission Employee Class (Child of Commission Employee):
Extending the capabilities of the 'Commission Employee' class, this subclass accommodates employees with a hybrid compensation model, encompassing both a base salary and commissions.

Our Payroll Management System stands as a testament to the commitment to excellence in software design, offering a scalable, maintainable, and extensible solution for effective payroll administration. Embrace efficiency, reliability, and adaptability with our sophisticated OOP-based Payroll Management System.
